## 📝 Naming Convention
- **Base solution**: `problemname.java`
- **Optimized solution**: `problemnameO.java` (O suffix indicates optimized)
- **Alternative approach**: `problemname2.java`

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Each file is self-contained and runnable
2. Run any solution: `javac filename.java && java ClassName`
3. Check comments for complexity analysis and approach explanation
4. Test cases cover edge cases and typical scenarios

**Priority Order** (recommended):
1. **Foundation**: Arrays, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack
2. **Core DS**: Binary Search, Linked List, Trees
3. **Advanced**: DP, Graphs, Backtracking
4. **Specialized**: Tries, Heaps, Intervals, Bit Manipulation
